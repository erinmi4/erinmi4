## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm a Chinese college student with a profound passion for Japanese culture.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Japanese language, history, and traditional arts like tea ceremony and anime culture. Diving into these aspects helps me understand Japan better.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Japanese pop culture trends, differences between Chinese and Japanese cultural values, or any interesting Japanese festivals. I'm always excited to share my knowledge and views.

âš¡ Fun fact: I once participated in a cosplay event dressed as a character from a popular Japanese anime. It was an amazing experience to meet so many like - minded fans and show my love for Japanese pop culture.
